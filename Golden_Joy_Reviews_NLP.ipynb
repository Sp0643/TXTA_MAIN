              "'Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard so much about this place and decided to try it with family and friends. We ordered the Sweet Corn Chicken Soup and it was spot on. Tasty and hot. The fried prawn balls were great as well but too salty for me. The fried Paneer was also good. For dinner, we got Manchurian Chicken and Chilli Chicken. Fried rice and noodles as well. I thought the food was very good. We knew the manager so we were taken care of very well. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to try some Indian Chinese cooking.Show less Very slow service. The staff members are hardly aware of their duties. The food items were okay-ish, nothing much to write about. Visited the place with family for dinner, on a weeknight. The road in front of the restaurant is pretty narrow and it is advisable to use the available valet parking service if you are driving a car. The facility is pretty large, with the ground floor dedicated to stags (gents area mentioned on the door). The family area is on the first floor consisting of dining halls on to the left and right as you climb up the stairs. The halls are pretty spread out and large, with comfortable seating, but not much space between tables (making the most out of the space)....the result being noisy ambiance, which is pretty common in almost all bar cum restaurants in Kolkata.The service captain was pretty prompt to take the order for the soup and starter, mentioned that he would take the order for the main course in a while. But we waited, starter was served without the soup, and then the soup was served and we almost finished the soup, but no one came to take the main course order. Had to call for the captain again to give the order and also ask for water (apparently they forgot to serve water as we sat). As a result, we were sitting idle for almost 15-20 min after finishing our starter and soup. The food quality and quantity were good and we did enjoy a wholesome meal of Indianised Chinese cuisine. Coming to think of it, poor service has been a very common factor marring an otherwise good food experience in many of the restaurants. In this case, I didn\\'t even find any shortage of staff.In the end, it was a good dinner and credit to us that we did not allow the poor service to meddle with our good time.Show less This has been in our wish list for a very long time, but every time we visited China Town, we couldn\\'t overcome the urge to visit Big Boss or Beijing and hence, could never visit Golden Joy. However, this time we were determined to visit the place and luckily we got seats as well for a late lunch. Coming to the food we ordered:Chicken Sweet Corn Soup - They have option of Small/Medium/Large, the staff suggested Small one by two would be good for two of us. Chicken Satay Stick - As a starter, this was delicious and the best dish in our lunch that dayPrawn Chips - Normal, nothing to review hereChicken Thai Fried Rice - Good, but the Thai touch was missingSingapore Chilli Fish - GoodCaramel Custard - The portion size was very small and not that tastyButterscotch Ice Cream - GoodOverall, a good place to dine in China Town.Show less Actually I am visiting this restaurant in tangra\\'s Chinese food (one can even ask for authentic Chinese food though I never liked it because of it\\'s blunt taste) hub for the last 17 years or more and it is maintaining the quality of food \"sans exception\". A must try for foodies.Show less Visited this restaurant for dinner....spacious restaurant and polite staff. Some food items could have been better. 3% tip is added to the bill which is optional. welcome by smile, which extended to an amazing dinner, Food quality and quantity Tops.. value for money. Highly recommended. \\n\\nCheers I can\\'t talk about the ambience of the restaurant or the service as I had got food home delivered from here.Food ordered:1. Thread Chicken2. Hakka Shrimp3. Golden Fried FishAll the dishes were delicious! Thread chicken and Fried fish were completely non-spicy. Hakka Shrimp was a little bit spicy but nothing overpowering. Show less Good place for drinks and snacks especially those with Chinese menu preferences.\\n\\nParking available.\\n\\nValue for money. Family can go - Yes. Separate section is there. We visited this restaurant as part of my desire to explore the so-called Chinatown of Kolkata. I must say I returned utterly disappointed.The so-called Chinatown is non existent. What remains is a few Chinese cuisine restaurants scattered here and there amidst dark and lonely bylanes. Golden Joy is one of such places, which I found brightly lit at the front facade, full to the brim with guests inside and served food that was at best average. I did not enjoy the visit at all. The ambience is nothing great to write about nor is the waiting staff\\'s service. The location is really bad too; hidden inside a really dark and lonely bylane. We had trouble finding any taxi after the dinner and the one that came by also had a nasty time trying to move and turn around in the narrow lane outside the restaurant.We tried food like the rice noodles, egg noodles, chili mushroom babycorns, some soups, shakes, soda and a paneer dish by the name thread paneer. We liked the soups and the thread paneer dish. Everything else was quite average and nothing close to delicious. My opinion: give it a pass, it\\'s not worth the effort to reach there.Show less The genesis of Indian Chinese cuisine can be sampled at this restaurant. The restaurant is fairly large, has valet parking, and the food is excellent. The fried noodles dessert is amazing. One can savour good variety of Chinese food at this joint in Tangra, while at Kolkata, where quantity is large and cost moderate, The seating arrangements are laid out in large halls, which seemed too noisy, like in a coffee house. Service was adequate, but the elegance was missing. A little more refinement was expected on service. Overall it was a good experience, where the main dishes were very tasty and good, specially the Golden fried prawns and prawn curry. Unfortunately, crab was out from the menu. Hence looking for for alternative to crab soup was a bit disappointing. At least, one is assured of good car parking space, and sitting for large number of guests simultaneously. The approach to the restaurant is not good. Best approached from the Metro Pillar no 40, on the main road from Park Circus towards Science City. Wish that the lane was better paved.Overall a good dining and a satisfying outing.Show less When it comes to Chinese food then it’ll definitely be Golden Joy in Kolkata. Foods are awesome taste is finger licking and price is how much u want to spend. Visiting on a Sunday evening is the best or worst time- very noisy, crowded full of family groups- 3 even 4 generations. Even then the service was excellent. But a warning- portions are designed for large groups. Being just 2 people means that even half portions are just too much!The cuisine is Indian-Chinese fusion, but more the latter than former. It was great but a shame we could not try more dishes- too sated!Show less China Town was in my bucketlist for long time. Last week I decided to visit and being one of the best of china town Golden Joy was my destination. The place has a Chinese touch to it which totally goes with the place. I had ordered Golden Special Soup, Fried Shrimp, Barbeque Chicken, Mixed Fried Rice & Singapore Chicken. The soup was pretty good & Fried shrimp tasted heavenly with Chilli Garlic Sauce. Barbeque Chicken is one of their special item and tasted very special. The Medium spiced Singapore Chicken goes well with Mixed Fried Rice; so the lunch was awesome. The Staff were very courteous but the service was pretty slow. Overall a nice experience.Show less Why is this place packed out & so popular?  Go find out for yourself!  Whenever we are in Kolkata, this is a MUST-VISIT place for us.  There Chinese food is THE BEST in Tangra and perhaps in Kolkata! Very friendly restaurant with a terrific selection of dishes on the menu. The food was very tasty and presented well. The Maître D suggested the dishes as I wasn’t sure of the food and he didn’t disappoint they were delicious great service. Thank you 😀👍 Tangra food is completely different from other Chinese food you get. Golden joy will give you food that satisfies your taste buds to the core. Try golden fried prawns.. They are mind blowing. Even the mundane noodles taste so damn good. Folks! The place is packed every day and they take bookings only up-to 7.30 so go early and enjoy the experience to the maxShow less We visited them on 31st evening for a family outing with kids. Locating the hotel wasnt tough and there was valet parking as well.The restaurant was teeming with people but luckily we got our seat immediately. It took nearly 15 mins for waiter to come for order. Till that time, even our request for bottled water fell in deaf ears. Seems no one would touch the table till the designated waiter comes.The starter and soup came in standard time but the main course took extraordinarily great time. Service quality is quite poor. Surprisingly, we found food taste also not at par. Pretty bland mostly.Ambience is also pretty std like many other large restaurants.Overall our experience was not good and much below expectation. Can it be an aberration as it was 31st? May be but crowd was normal like and Friday nights or weekends...Show less The ambience of the hotel is good. There is place for car parking. The quality of food is great and you can order half plate also. I had visited these place many times when I used to reside at Kolkata.. during my short to visit to Kolkata these time I visited these place 2 times .. you get to sit out here chatting with your friends and order delicious Chinese dishes and liquor.. the best thing is you can order any drinks as per bottle and not on the basis of peg .. hence it becomes extremely cheap.. Golden fried Prawn and Pepper chicken are the most popular dishes out here .. also not to miss the extremely popular Prawn Chips .. very good service, extremely tasty food, very affordable cost, ample parking facility and nice ambience makes this restaurant the most popular restaurant of Tangra China Town in Kolkata..Show less Had always heard about the legacy of eateries China town in Kolkata.Golden Joy just proved it! Worth every penny And the food was FINGER LICKING GOOD!! They were even gracious enough to cook up a customised chowmein for my toddler! The yummy Drums of heaven, soup,noodles and rice can’t get enough of it!!! Thank you Golden Joy... for the joyous experience!Show less I was there for lunch yesterday with family . The family section on the first floor was full but we anyhow got a table. Since this was recommended to me by a friend so I wanted to give it a try and also because there are a few restaurants we go to in tangra , so it would be a change.The place is huge and the guys are not well trained to take orders or give suggestions to first timers. The food is very average . The place is very noisy and you cannot enjoy your food because the tables are very close to each other. It\\'s maddening...I feel smaller places in tangra serve better Chinese. Show less Golden Joy is probably the most talked about chinese joint in Tangra. Nice ambience, quick service, tasty food and a very reasonable price. Prawn as a starter is a must try. Recommended.. Golden joy has some really amazing dishes, Golden fried prawns, Spring fish. The signature soup was quite nice too. Portion size are fairly large. Place is packed on weekend & can be slightly noisy during dinner The food at Golden Joy was the best I have eaten in a long time! What an amazing lunch it was! Generous, delicious dishes from start to finish! The appetizers were great, as was the main course, not to forget the dessert! The golden fried baby corn, the fish fingers and the shrimp pakora were the perfect appetizers. We ordered an array of dishes--- chicken and fish--- not to forget the mixed fried rice and the chow mein---- perfect! The service was immaculate. Clearly, this is a very popular place that attracts the young and old alike. Lots of families who were, just like us, enjoying a leisurely Sunday lunch! Would recommend this to anyone interested in savoring mouthwatering Chinese cuisine in Kolkata\\'s Chinatown! Will come here for sure on my next visit to Kolkata! Very well priced so easy on the pocket too!Show less China town is well known in Kolkata. Golden joy is the oldest one in this list. Golden fry prawn is the signature item of this place. People believed it to be the cheapest place to have drinks but now there are many in sector 5 in Kolkata to have there names in this band.Show less The Chilli Garlic Red Pepper Chicken as a starter was very good. A friend of mine and I enjoyed the Red Pepper Chicken as well though the others the group did not like it. I didnt try the Golden Fried prawns but my friends liked it. Starters were primarily crispy on the outside and quite soft inside.Since I was pretty full with the starters, I just had a bit of Chicken Hakka Noodles for the main course which was nice.Brownie with Vanilla Icecream and Hot Chocolate sauce was very very good so a nice ending to the evening.Lots of parking available so thats not a problem at all.The approach road as per Google Map while going from Salt Lake was very bad so better to avoid that - full of pot holes and water logging. Take the main approach road which might be a bit longer but far better.Show less we went out with friends for a dinner at this place, as it was referred to us, and this place doesn\\'t lets you down. it serves amazing Chinese  food and the ambiance also great.\\nMix soup along with souce is a must try..loved the food.. We have visited Golden Joy for a dinner with our cousins. The restaurant was fully packed. The ambience was great. We six had lot of awesome and yummy items..specially the Red Chilli Fried Fish n Chicken dragon in starters and rice noodles in main course.. the rate is also very reasonable. Show less I love this place in Tangra, the renowned China Town of Kolkata. Don\\'t expect fine dining here and believe me this is like the China Town across many cities where I have personally visited the local China Town namely, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, London, to name some. I visit this place once in 3 to 4 months with friends and colleagues usually on weekdays and I am amazed to see it to be always full.The golden fried prawns are heavenly and you can have them with beer or scotch... they have a decent range and guess what, you get buy a bottle. My favorites are Cantonese chowmein, mixed fried rice... followed by the good old tangra style chilli chicken, chili crab, chili prawns, fried chicken and the list of appetizers go on.Service is not that professional... but if you can be a bit friendly with the server and be kind to him in the way you speak, it should be good enough for you to get the required attention.Show less My first negative review. Never been to a place worse than this. I wonder why people come to this place.Cheap dirty interiors like I expected and hence that was not a concern.It took 10 minutes and a multiple promote to take our order. The person who took the order kept on making comments and suggestions and would not just listen to us. I am writing this review as I am waiting for the food. I am determined not to give it any more than 1 star even if the food is good or rest of the service is good however I will share my real feedback further. Started a conversation with a group of Chinese people on the table next to me and they too complained about the terrible service and the place being dirty. They say the food was okay and nothing for them to come back again. I am hoping my food is good. So the stir fry chicken starter was deep fried not what I ordered. The stir fry vegetables were straight out of a can. The chicken in black bean sauce was surprisingly good but will not be the reason for me to recommend this place to anyone.Stay away.Show less First the good points :1) Food is good. Price is pocket friendly as the other restaurants in Tangra. 2) Ambiance is also very good. Ample and comfortable space for sitting. In a busy time when the tables are fully booked, they will took you to their massive terrace where they have made their waiting arrangements, unlike others where you have to stay outside. 3) Service is quite fast after giving the order.Now, after reading the the above review, one may wonder that what the point which has made me so dissatisfy. All the things which we normally look before taking the service of a restaurant is OK here. Here comes the point :When we go to a restaurant, it not only the food and ambiance, we also go there to get pampered. Just imagine a restaurant, where the person taking your order is not even looking at you. He was looking at other direction when you are asking him for a perfect menu. I have visited there thrice and every time I faced similar problem. All the three times I had attended by three different servers. And most surprisingly all of these three lack courteousness. They behave like they are managers of the place. I am probably not able to express the feelings I got all the three times, in a single line I can say that I was not very satisfied their way of answering a simple questing, \"what you suggest to take today?\" Its only happens when the servers are not properly trained about the food and doesn\\'t know how to pamper the customers by guiding them to a proper menu which they relish and satisfy their taste bud. So, I will be not visiting this restaurant again.Show less Large Restaurant, good ambience and great food with a bar to help ones thirst ! Some unique preparations like special momo / dimsum, Sewmai, prawns on a sugarcane stick, BBQ Chicken, steamed whole Beckty Fish etc make the place a popular destinationSmaller rooms with Karaoke facility are available for private parties.The owner and his sons are very hospitable and professional and keep upgradingShow less Prawns salt pepper is great can order half plate too;The mix chowmien is very tasty also ordered Prawns kum Pao;Ambience is very homely as mostly visited by families on the first floor; open whole day for lunch landed up having food at 4pm thought wouldn\\'t get something at this hour. Should be able to bear a bit of mix up of things if they are full in numbers. Overall Good!Show less Am from Mumbai and was expecting a differentiated, unique taste of Kol Chinese cuisine. To some extent got it eg fish was the very tasty Bekti instead of the standard Basa in Mumbai. Service attentive and considerate. Portions large. Very busy. Gregarious noisy groups of diners-- caused protest from some other diners but peaceful and conciliatory --even though Bengalis are quite emotional and exprsesive. Aircon initially very cold but good for bringing down my core temperature on an exceptionally hot afternoon. They turned it down on my request. ---prices moderate.Did n ot meet expectations in following ways:--- Garam masala in some dishes-should never be there in Chinese food however Indianized.---No Pork or beef or mutton dishes--Usual choice of chicken. prawns or \"fish\"---no choice of types of fish - that too in Kol !--So a standard eating joint not gourmet or fine diningShow less The ambience is good but the sitting shouldn\\'t be differenciated on a gender base, the thought is quite outdated and a bit upsetting too. However some of the preparations were fantastic. Overall had a good time. Went there after a tiring train ride. The service was good and fast. The food was delicious and even the quantity was good for 2 people. Booze is also available. The rates are also pretty reasonable. Recently visited Golden Joy for team dinner, Food here is really good and lip smacking and best part is its not expensive at all. we had tried Chicken, Pork & Prawn and all dishes are really good , specially Prawn Wonton . also there is a provision you can get a full bottle of drink ,so if you are planning to visit this place with friends and colleagues and majority will drink then you can try this option. though interior decoration is not that good and service quality is also not up to the mark but if you are looking for a budget friendly place to hangout with quality Chinese food this is your destination.Show less A place where families and men only segregated seriously. Crowded. People seems love the food here. But everything is fried. Perhaps time to look at dishes with Tofu etc and not frying everything. But got the charm and reasonable prices. Alcohol available. Food was great, service was good little bit costly. The cuisine is large so no worries if u come with large number of people. I went there when ever I come India after so long. And I felt homely there this restaurant is full of facilities, services and presentation. It is situated in market you can go ourltside for shopping outside.. Have great time there just you won\\'t regret for sure..Show less Just drop by and indulge in some finest preparations of gourmet with fine wines or simply hard drinks... Decorative atmosphere with on the edge service from trained tenders and staffs... Prompt service and exquisite food quality which will not burn your pocket a bit..... Simply fab....Show less I am here today with my wife, son and two nieces. This is one of the popular Chinese food joint in famous China Town in Ranges , East Calcutta. It is Saturday evening, we reached the place at 7.45 and the place is already near full. The ambience is average but clean. Service is fast and efficient. We started with clear chicken soup then shredded chicken, a deep fried chicken finger coated with rice noodles. It was followed by the house speciality golden fried prawn , spring fried prawn and chicken drumsticks. You can order either full (14) or half (7) plate of each dish. Then came pan fried noodles with chicken. Noodles was very well prepared with crispy and gravy combination with lot of chicken and pick choy and broccoli. We ended our dinner with Dar San served with Vanilla Ice Cream. Preparation was good with adequate quantity . When we finished our dinner and coming out huge number of guest were waiting patiently outside for their turn to get their table, such is the popularity of this joint.Show less Good food quality. Awesome Decoration. Good behaviour.  Super place to meet friends,  couple & Family .I want to go again as soon as possible. Food was average \"Just average\" I have been to better places in kolkata for chinise. WORST!! staff ever there was more staff then customers, even then I had to wait 20min for someone to take the order, this guy starts taking the order, for a bit I was confused if I was placing the order or taking an order. I wanted to place starter and mains at the same time but this guy wouldn\\'t take the mains order. Anyways we places an order for the starter. Food finally arrived. After finishing the starter we had to wait another good 15-20 min for someone to take the order for the main course, now again the same guy comes to take the other \"rather making me feel that he is placing the order\". OK we had our food, asked them to get the bill, the bill comes with x 3, x 2 which we haven\\'t even eaten or placed an order for ( highly recommend all to throughly check bill before paying ) called an staff to check the bill the same guy comes pretending not to remember what order we have placed. Well they took the receipt to make the adjustment which took them good 30 min. 30min ? To adjust the bill? Reall ? The the staff that took the order openly asks for tip. OVER ALL THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, WILL NOT RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE TO NO ONE. Show less The ambiance and food was superb.. It can be a party , friends gathering or simply enjoying.. but no official meet possible. good food and drinks. not so costly... They have a smoking area also... Went out for a dinner with family and friends on Tuesday evening for drinks and dinner after a long break to Tangra China town, the place didn\\'t disappointed us still the same awesome food quality, great portion size, friendly staff and lovely ambience .For any one who looking for great Chinese food without burning a hole in his pocket can definitely pay a visit Show less A value for food family restaurant, me and my family just love the food served at this restaurant. But we love the most is the fried prawn. Oh boy, absolutely delicious. We have had various deep fried preparations, noodle dishes both fried and boiled, exclusive vegetables, crab, duck, all sorts - each and every dish had its own specific character and taste. Never found any reason to complain. Show less This place is just AWSOME. Was recommended by my team to surely go and try it but they also warned me that the portion size is large so go with friends. Could find any so went alone. And ended up having only two half portions of starters. Service is very friendly and suggestive. They warn you as soon as you start ordering more. Everything in the menu is available and trust me it\\'s a huge menu. I simply lived the food prep. A very friendly owner Fredrick welcomes you at the entrance and ensures to interact. There place is large and have enough space for groups. Alcohol is also served. People in groups take bottles of alcohol to share. Portion sizes are large. Show less this place serves the best chinese in chinatown. having tasted food from other restaurants in chinatown i came to this conclusion. the atmosphere is very family friendly as there is separate seating arrangements for large groups and family as well. bar service is also available. they have good parking place. staff is very helpful and polite.Show less It was a nice experience. The food was ok nd the atmosphere is average. Behaviour of the staffs were good. I have been a few times to Golden Joy in Tangra. Have never been disappointed. Great food! Huge helpings and it is the best for me in Chinese Food here. It is situated Off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, after the Park Circus crossing and what I would call is not the fabulous location. It is also refer to as The China Town here. Safe for a family outing and the ambience is so.On holidays during lunch time it is quite full and so it would be prudent if you would make a reservation. Have never been for dinner so really cannot say but people have visited.Show less Food was OK so I found the cost little higher than what it should be.\\nThe staff members were good ,but the cuisine could have been better Food and service is good. Understand the need of the guests. Although a bit overcrowded but understood after dining. Why the restaurant was so busy. Keep it up. After a hectic work, decided to spent a quality time where we can have nice food drinks and a good service so we decided to choose this restaurant. Unfortunately it couldn\\'t be happen. First we order beer n chicken garlic and I requested some Bhujiyaa or peanuts which we can start the drink. D guy said Sir your chicken will come in 2mins so not to order. I was okay!!! But it took more than 30mins and at last moment a senior Chinese old guy said sorry your order has been placed to another table by mistake. What kind of explanation was that!!! That Chinese senior was quick and prompt. But the rest with red dress was unresponsive and very rude. Most funny part was that when the bill was clear a guy came with that red dress who was checking the bill folder, he just throw the folder when he don\\'t see any tip. By the way he don\\'t deserve to get it also not that but he should be fired for that attitude. Please do respect people\\'s time and train your staffs properly. Thank you to that Chinese senior who save my day from my girlfriend!!!Show less I visited Golden Joy with great expectations and I wasn\\'t disappointed..The food though indo-chinese was still very tasty. It did not taste like street side food but tasted like proper gourmet food.We had the mixed hakka chowmein and friend rice which was delicious...The starters were tasty too...The main course chicken hot garlic was also very tasty. Quantity of food served is also very good. They serve drinks and the menu is quite reasonable not too expensive or unaffordable..The service staff are polite and make an effort to get your food on time without much waiting. The only thing I din like much was the dining hall the interior decoration reminded me of a dining hall at a marriage function. Rest is good..restrooms were also clean.Show less Recently visited with friends and was fun with food and drinks. The services are quick while the setup is basic.\\nGreat place to party with friends. Went to Golden Joy after my son pointed out that it was highly rated on Zomato. Located in Tangra which is little difficult to reach. Food quality is outstanding. The fish & pork dishes are really well made. Most chinese restaurants in 7 around Tangra do not serve pork, so this is a major plus point for Golden Joy.Show less This restaurant is my favorite in China Town. They have good parking space, good interiors and awesome food. You won\\'t want to miss this on your trip to Kolkata. Restaurant looks good.. But worst behaviour... We were family but unfortunately no women were with us.. Downstairs was disgusting jam packed people shouting.. We just wanted to have good foods & lil drink in calm... I took my cousins with great expectation but unfortunately we had to leave the restaurant for harsh behaviour of the waiters upstairs... Who insisted on bringing lady partner otherwise we wouldn\\'t be allowed... But is he so dumb can\\'t see the profile of the guests before denial..... Behaviour was so rude that we had to leave soon & change to beijing which was good no discrimination...Show less Amazing food ... awesome service .... The best Chinese restaurant in Tangra ........ ask for Frederick. .. Awesome food, polite staff and we were served by the owner\\'s son (Frederick) he was very friendly and gave awesome suggestions..... loved it Although it\\'s massive, it\\'s always crowded which speaks volumes about how good the food is. \\nI prefer the starters to the main course - the pak Choy, chilli prawns, golden fried prawns, thread chicken are all my personal favourites I love it. I love this place..the food is awesome..parking is awesome..hospitality is awesome...service is awesome..in china town I can\\'t think any name beside Golden Joy..love it.. We went to Golden Joy at Tangra ( China Town ) in Kolkata last Sunday with colleagues from work. It was an evening well spent with lots of good chatting among us and some great food and drinksThere is a valet parking below the main restaurant and I used my GPS to locate it as I was a first timer there.My friends were waiting outside and we went up a flight of stairs to reach two adjoining big halls,teeming with diners. There was a big TV on the wall,on which IPL was shown.We sat down together. There were about 15 of us and our tables were united and pre-booked. I ordered beer ( Kingfisher Light ) and it was served fairly chilled and bottle was opened in front of me. We also ordered huge quantity of snacks as there were about 5 more of us to come. We had everything from Chicken roast (awesome taste but with bones ) to Golden fried prawn, Sauteed mushrooms to Chicken Drum sticks to pan fried fish to prawn flavored popadums . I ordered a Chicken sweet corn soup too among next few rounds of beerThere were small cozy corners for couples but all places were full on a Sunday evening. I am not sure whether it is good for having business meetings,as inside it is too loud and nearly chaoticService staff was reasonably good and prompt. There weren\\'t any appreciable delay in getting the orders on our tableOverall experience was very good although we were so full by having drinks and starters that we actually didn\\'t order any main courseShow less Food is very delicious.. Value for money.. Nice place to hang out with family and friends.. I would difinately visit it every month :-) This was my first and surely my last visit. Having arrived early at around 6:30 pm the place was almost deserted (there was only one other group). And yet it took them nearly 30 mins to find us a table. And after another 30 mins and repeated episodes of \"Excuse me, can we have the menu card\", the menu finally arrived. Then a person asked whether we want regular or mineral water. We chose regular and the water was finally served after the main course (unbelievable..!!) and that too at boiling hot temperature. Next the waiter misplaced the bottle opener and left our beer bottles sealed. When he finally came with a bottle opener, we were already half way through our beers (after having opened the bottle with table spoon). But the worst part came when we were almost done with the main course and the waiter came and asked \" Bol bhai..aur kuchh lega kya\" (to which one member of our group replied no thanks and I\\'m not your brother..!!). Although China Town is not the place to go if you are looking for fine dining but even then you expect a bare minimum of courtesy and service from a restaurant. Came out with a bitter experience (despite the food being better than many nearby restaurants to be honest).Show less Its One of the best chiness restaurants in Kolkata,  Food Quality is very good, well support stuff ,Mainly Mr. Utpal ...\\nVery Good  ambience.\\nRecommended own CAR... I have been there twice. Both time with friends. Good food and very good service. Good ambience too. And it totally comes at a reasonable price. Good delicious Chinese food with decent ambiance. Definitely better than many others in china town, tangra. Well behaved staffs. Value for the money. often i go there. one if the staff is very caring. his name is john. i like the food served here. service is also good. price is also reasonable. so please visit if you want to taste the indian style chinese food in kolkata. it is really mouthwatering.Show less Well , one of the finest Chinese food . Great quantity at affordable price . The veg food is amazing . Also a good option for non veg lovers and drink lovers This is one of the regular joint of ours and we visit quite frequently, tangra is destination for good Chinese food, and golden joy is one of the best options avilable there, boiled fish in white sauce is one of the best along with golden prawns (that\\'s what we like as starter ),they do serve pork and crabs ..almost all dishes are very nice and best part is the quantity. ...They do serve alcohol Show less The ambience and interiors might not be the USP of the place but they do have ample parking space available with valet service. Esthetically the place will not give an appealing factor and has that desi Indian restaurant look.The staff is courteous and active. Food quality is nice if not too great. A place where there is true value for money due to extremely good portion size.Show less Just saw only one of the sections of this restaurant and it was massive. The steamed prawns tasted extremely nice specially with the unique sauce. They serve the best fried rice I have ever had. The only thing which lets it down is that the place is extremely noisy and you have to yell to have a conversation on your table.Show less Frankly the ambience does not enthuse you much. A bit cramped with average interiors, you start doubting whether you chose the right place. However, the food served from starter to soup to the main course are very good and certainly will give 5 star hotels a stiff competition. The service was fast if not of great quality. Prices are very competitive and I must complement the Chef and his team for the quality of food. The preparations are generally light and not oily. Overall very good food and great value for money. Will be back for sure....Show less This is the second time me and my family had lunch at this joint. The food is well cooked, original Chinese cuisine, quantity is sumptuous, cannot expect more. We are certainly going there again. By far one of the best places for food, quality, serving quantity, taste and menu. They serve very economical drinks, have valet parking and a smoking zone inside the restaurant. So many tables and all full till late hours on Thursdays as well. Golden Joy surprised me with the food. Highly recommended for Chinese food. If you have been to tangra before and havent visited Golden Joy you have to do it.Show less Visited last weekend with family members. Initially was not feeling good as this place is bit far from main road. But later after entering into the restaurant my thought have changed. Food quality, quantity and taste - all awesome! The behavior of crew members are also nice, gentle and humble. I would definitely say, this is one of the best places to have authentic Chinese food in Kolkata. Last but not the least, this place is very much pocket friendly for sure.Show less The first thing to be said about this place is that its Amazing.It specializes in the Chinese food we Indians like to have.The ambiance is good and the prices are very reasonable.To be honest,one of the best in Kolkata.A must try. This place is located in Tangra, has good seating capacity, liquor section has good stocks and brands at reasonable prices along with the food which is very tasty and quality one.....place has prompt staffs and is clean and hygienic also....is also ideal for family gatherings..... Golden Fried Prawns are a must if you come here.The full plate comes with 14 pieces and sufficient for 4-5 members.Incase you plan to go on a weekend , try to go early as theres a lot of rush. I prefer Chinese food, as my family, we had an opportunity to visit China town at Tangra, this is my second visit after a long 15 years. I really don’t have any idea where to go, then I saw Golden Joy restaurant, we thought let’s try, we parked our car & entered in to the restaurant. We divided our meal in three different segments staring with soup, fry, dumpling, noodles, rice & various chicken items. Frankly speaking I found they serve one of the good quality foods in decent price Kolkata, I would suggest try once if you have opportunity to visit Tangra, Kolkata.Show less The best part is food, but the space is little bit clumsy. Very good for new couple.\\nThe bad part is not so clean there are no table cloth and table mat. The restaurant located at Tangra has a separate family seat out with parking facility with specialised in Chinese cuisine. The quantity is enough for 2 persons sharing single plate. Can try out: Prawn chips, Chilli Fish specially. But remember the food is too oily specially chowmein or fried rice. Show less Better and cheaper than most big China Town Players. Authentic Chinese and budget menu, that\\'s a delicious combination for any group events be it with friends or family. China town has better ones such as Big Boss and Beijing. So for those who could not find any place there it can be also a choice. If you have eaten Chinese in India you would know that it tastes somewhat same wherever you are. This at least in the major cities. Golden Joy was perhaps the tastiest Chinese food I have eaten in India. Now this is really in comparison with the regular Chinese eateries and not the exotic ones. If you plan to visit here do come early to block your table. Try the Kung pao it\\'s really delicious. Show less The food was good but not great. However they have a good choice of dishes from dim-sums to prawns. We had an array of rice, noodles, soups enough to feed an army.The interiors look old and shabby and it is quite dark.Service is very average.Show less Big place good food and more over great taste to enjoy. Try Golden fried prawn, threaded chicken and rice noodles as these are quite good. Good value for money but waiting time is almost 30 minutes. So keep calm and enjoy great food. Visit if you are in a large group, the food portions are enormous and being in a small group will not give you options to explore. At Golden Joy, you will get both best food and best drinks, great place to hangout with friends and family. Very awesome environment and sometimes you got to wait outside... best noodles :) \\nI usually dont like paneer, but here is was even delis! Thank you for the great dinner. I will definatly be back next time in Kol. Great servers, very friendly. Thank you for a lovely meal! A typical Kolkatan China Town restaurant. Quantity per serving is huge, taste is also good. Moderately priced, good to visit in a large group so that you can try out several items. The servers can be a bit more friendly though! We were a group of 9. Firstly, I liked that we found a round table... Now a days, its rare to find a round table for large group. Anyways let\\'s come to food and drinks. Hunan fish, Chicken sauté was good, Chicken drumstick & Chilly pork(dry) in starters, were also delicious. But they served chicken chopsey in the name of chicken salad.... :D we didn\\'t make it an issue since it was tasty. However, if u r interested in drinks.... Don\\'t order any cocktail/mocktails... Those were really pathetic. I think this place is good for sipping beer or drinking whisky only. And service is not quick enough. It can be uncertain if ur table is allotted to the waiter MARK... He listens everything very carefully and then forgets to send it to kitchen. :D :D. Its ur responsibility to check whether ur orders are being prepared to be served at all! Anyways... Apart from his absend-mindedness... I liked the guy.Have a sumptuous Chinese meal there... U will not dislike it.Show less Enjoyed a lot. Thank you for making our dinner so special in the busy restaurant. However scope of improvement is still there. I dont do well with chinese food, but golden joys crab claws are delectable!! Thats the biggest plus. For people who love chinese, do rush. N drinks are cheaper thanks to the tax exemption at china town. The rich chinese decor is fascinating too. My association with Golden Joy or rather its owner Robert Liao goes back more than twelve years when the tanneries in Tangra or the Chinatown of Kolkata were being shifted to outskirts. Most of the tannery owners were left with huge palatial places. Most of them started a side business by opening a restaurant.Robert started Golden Joy with a small portion in his huge premise, and over the years has grown it to a huge destination for food lovers. Many people wont know, but its his passion for personal touch in everything whether it\\'s the decor or ingredients, that has made him so successful and popular among the Kolkatans. It serves the best (Indian) Chinese delicacies at a fairly reasonable price in Kolkata. Don\\'t get confused by my comment \"Indian Chinese\". Having spent a considerable time in Beijing, China I have learnt that authentic Chinese food is completely different than the \\'Chinese\\' food we have in India. Hence the comment. They use the best of the ingredients and raw materials under watchful supervision of Robert himself. Over the years, I have seen his three sons grow up and joining the business very capably. Golden Joy offers a very wide variety of starters and main course. Try the Golden Fried Prawn if you are a seafood lover. Or, Chilli Garlic Red Pepper Chicken or Fish. Once you eat here, you will not be able to go anywhere else. I can vouch for this from my experience of years. Any friend or relative , I have introduced here, has remained loyal and brought their friends as well. You can spot many celebrities too on occasional visits. Anyway, that is not the catch. They take group bookings, on normal days or occassions. Robert has added a new portion that can be used as an exclusive private dining area, on prior booking. Depending on number of guests, the area can be divided by a foldable partition. Another good thing is that the waiters have remained with him from almost the beginning of the restaurant, except few. So, once you are a regular, they remember your face and the service is always very good. For festive days, there is a huge terrace where people can sit and wait.Overall a highly recommended place for everyone. Enjoy your food !Show less well affordable or rather really cheap drinks available with loads of tasty dishes though not too many cocktails available there.  Service is also bit slow.... but you can\\'t expect anything more at this price. This is one of the good restaurant in kolkata china town area. You will find lots of Chinese restaurant in this area but this is one of good of those. If you go with family .go upstair for family room. Food is so so..not authentic Chinese but in kolkata style. You can enjoy drinks also as they have bar also. There are some serving boys who serve you food at half rate which will not come on bill bit that half money you need to give to that guy. So you can understand what types of management and control over there. Area is very clean. Environment is also good. So you can come and try. Show less I was returning to Tangra after about 35 years. Last time around, it was dark alleys and people selling food out of drums in the lanes there, and the question asked was \"you pork or you no pork\". After that, you got food in a bowl, hot and steaming, and you got a pair of chopsticks or a fork.Now Tangra is all swank and we went to one of the swankier places going - Golden Joy.This is Kolkata at its best. People dress up to come and eat here. So point number one - look clean.Next, the day we went, the ground floor was shut. Don\\'t let that worry you. Upstairs is as big as a barn.And finally, on the food? The menu is very extensive and very complicated so have an idea of what you want to eat before you go.We wanted to eat pork, lightly grilled and variously sauced, and that\\'s what we got. Underbelly cut, not ribs, and in a variety of flavours, Chewy and just right, with chef\\'s suggestion of noodles to go with it.If you are in Kolkata and reaching the airport early on the way out, this is about half-way from town. Don\\'t miss it. I can still taste and smell the food, a few months later.Show less Strategically located at the entrance of Chinatown next to Beijing. Valet parking was like a breeze. A group of 17 corporates visited during lunch. Table was made available immediately. This restaurant has the best ambiance in the locality.In starters we ordered Stuffed Mushroom and Threaded Paneer for the vegetarians. While the non-vegetarians selected Threaded Chicken, Lut Me Chicken, Woolly Chicken and Golden Fried Prawn. Each and every item of starters are excellent and must try. Special mention about Thread Chicken which hotel management claims can only be available here in the world. Skipping such signature dish is a sin.During main course in rice we ordered Mixed Sichuan Fried Rice, Mixed Fried Rice and Vegetable Fried Rice. We felt like stupid by ordering variety but there was no difference visually or taste wise among these dishes. Mixed Friend Rice had only chicken but nothing else. As side dishes we asked for Lemon Chili Chicken, Hunan Chicken, Sichuan Chicken and Chili Paneer. Apart from Lemon Chili Chicken all sauces tasted same. Even servers were confused by looking at the dish which is what while serving. Lemon Chili Chicken had not hint of lemon in the taste. No compliant taste wise but food also has visual value. Felt like cheated.Apart from custard nothing else was available in dessert. Cup ice cream was served in a bowl with the same green spoon.We found the captain Mr. Mark who was noting down order was very absent minded and while taking order he kept on looking around the hotel and suddenly moving from one table to another in middle of noting down KOT. Servers were slow and was not serving food correctly. Captain was clueless. A huge improvement in service and visual appeal for dishes are required. Bill came to INR 6400 with beer and lime soda. In short didn\\'t live up to my expectation though opening was great with starters.Show less This restaurant is located in Tanga, opposite the restaurant Beijing. I usually go to two Chinese restaurants whenever I am in India and this restaurant is No. 1 on the list. The food is really good and the service really exceptional. They even customize the spices for my wife.Show less Was there with school friends. Located in China town. Very basic place. Good typical Kolkata Chinese food at good price. Even though they mess up with my chow every time, they have an excellent menu with lot of variety. If you are looking for varied menu of Chinese food and a place to hang out and be loud. This is the place,.Till recently their service was up to mark, but has been on decline for sometime. Expect lots of oil in your food which remains tasty, if you are looking for chow don\\'t even try.Their speciality are fried dishes and lemon chicken here is the best I have had.Show less It is one of the best Chinese joints in tangra\\nMixed manchow soup ,stir fry chilli chicken& mei-foon(rice noodles) are my favourites\\nService is very fast\\nAmbience is ok,it\\'s a huge place & most of the time it is crowded(400 seater restaurant) Golden Joy has a vast menu and a lot of variety of dishes. However, I find the food to be tasty but oily. Thread chicken was excellent but the cantonese noodles were a disappointment. But my issues are primarily with the service and the noise level at the restaurant!. The tables are packed together and one cannot hold any conversation at all!Show less I had been to this place many times and held this place as on the most authentic places for Chinese food in Kolkata. However, had a bad experience last week when I went there with a few friends. We requested for tarter sauce along with the fish finger that we had ordered. Sadly, none in the restaurant seemed to know what it was, so we were given a bowl of mustard sauce with a warning that it might taste \\'bitter\\'. They could not serve us cucumber in the green salad that we had ordered next, as all the cucumbers they had cut turned out to be bitter.... that was enough to make our evening bitter! I do not expect such unprofessional behavior from a well-known eatery in Tangra. Seems the management has somehow taken the place and the customers to be granted.Show less the quality n quantity of food makes u feel more hungry.i think the variety of items in chicken is mind blowing This place is inside Tangra ( China Town ) area near Vrindavan garden complex. This area has number of Chinese eateries and mostly the owners are of Chinese origins staying in Kolkata. The food is awesome out there because it\\'s authentic Chinese not like the indian cooked Chinese. For non veg eating peoples there are more options and they will enjoy more comparatively to veg eaters. A must go at this area to explore Chinese food. Show less If you want good and near authentic Chinese food in Tangra (Chinatown), pls do not think twice and just visit Golden Joy.\\nLots of seating capacity - perfect for big families and children.\\nPrice is slightly on the higher side. Food quality & quantity is very good. Environment & service is also awesome. We went in the evening & it was packed up. However, they delivered the food very quickly. Could not give five stars due to a small cleanliness issue. One reason could be that it was a Sunday Evening with a mad rush of crowd. There were about 100 odd waiting outside despite the large seating capacity of the restaurant. Otherwise an excellent Chinese restaurant with good variety of items. Special mention should be made for the golden fried prawns.. The service is quick and the staff are very courteous and polite, unlike few other in the vicinity. The portions are decently large and good enough for foodies. One can try the Kung pao gravy with chicken or fish.Show less We make it a point to eat at least one meal at Golden Joy. The food is delicious. They have enough space and the service is fast.  Cleanliness could be improved. Located in the beginning of Tangra, Golden Joy is a very large restaurant with very tasty and very well priced Chinese Food. Portions are very large and liquor is cheap and inexpensive. A Real Value for Money restaurant. The food is brilliant ,especially the golden prawns. Very good service and definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in Calcutta. Although its located in a strange location - A neighborhood that used to house all the tanneries in Kolkata, and very grungy and decrepit, the food\\'s good. The interiors are shabby, with dirty walls, stained table cloths and iffy hygiene, they serve Indian influenced Chinese food that Kolkata is famous for - the portions were huge and everything we ordered was delicious. The staff is very attentive and helpful . Worth checking out if you\\'re ok with dives with questionable hygiene. Show less I along with my colleague came to have dinner at your restaurant, We liked the services and food but we were served wrong dish which was little disappointing so i believe your order taker need some training..Other wise excellent experience. . Excellent chinese food. The best in China Town...rather in Kolkata!!I have been there quite a number of times & I just keep loving it!! Surely try out the Golden fried fish, Spring fried prawns, Dragon chicken & Chilli garlic red pepper chicken. Order your drinks in bottles rather than pegs, call over some friends & enjoy your dinner!!It has a great ambience & I\\'m extremely comfortable taking my son there!!Show less If you want to have good authentic Chinese food with excellent value for money, this is the place available from 12.30 pm till 10.30 pm non stop. Mind, you don\\'t order too much, since the serving per plate is quite big. To find the location may be little bit difficult. Show less Well I was told you get authentic Chinese in China town restaurants. So with that expectation I walked into Golden joy. They serve fish fingers and papads along with other Chinese regular dishes. I believe the cuisine was alerted to make it palatable to Indian tastes. The service is a bit casual. Pricing is fare. You will enjoy the place for sure, if your looking for good old Indian Chinese food. Show less Located in Tangra on the eastern fringes of the city, this is one of those restaurants that offer authentic Chinese food at a reasonable price. Access could be a problem during the rainy season, though. Valet parking is available. Food is tasty and the service good. I would specifically recommend the golden fried prawns. Families are seated upstairs. There is ample seating but reservations are recommended in view of the popularity of the placeShow less Excellent food with acceptable sense of hospitality. Must try golden fried fish. Price is worth however price of sea food may be revised to some extent. One of the excellent chinese food in the indian way.the resturant has name and fame in recent times. 2arlier it didn\\'t carried that ambience, now it is fantastic. Their is vallet parking. Only problem is that during rainy seasons the water get logged as the entire area is low land. Precisely called as china town of Kolkata.The owner and the staff is fantastic behaviour and a good place to enjoy the evening. 5rinks are also served.I prefer to take my family here always when ever I think of chinese food at China town. A lovely good joint for all.Show less Food & services are good, well decorated, car parking facilities are available, Liquors & foods are reasonable price. Let there be animosity between India and China...the ever-increasing love for Chinese Foods amongst Kolkatans is really surprising. Many may not be aware that there is a little China inside our very own Kolkata. This part of the city is known as Tangra and because of its \\'pure\\' Chinese population (many of whom are still legal citizens of China), people affectionately call it \\'China Town\\'. It is close to Science City off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. If one wants to have authentic Chinese cuisine with alcohol and good ambiance and still no burn in the pocket...the obvious destination would be \\'Golden Joy\\'! It is a pure family restaurant with valet parking facility. Place is completely safe for ladies even at late hours in the evening. In weekends they remain open till mid-night and we\\'ve seen families entering even as late as 10:30pm! I bet, in India no other city can boast of such Chinese delicacies at its purest form. If you plan to visit Kolkata, you must eat one evening at \\'China Town\\'. Note: Drinks are economical if ordered in bottles and not in pegs.Show less If you are a chinese food lover then this food joint would be ideal for you. The food price is reasonable and the quality is also very good. The mocktails are also good out here.. I had been to this restaurant for at least 10-12 times till date and found it quite comfortable.It serves yummy starters and best part is they maintain the standard of crowd.I have always visited there with family and felt very happy and safe with the ambiance and crowd visiting the place.they have got ample amount of sitting arrangement for big groups as well. Service is good.They have got separate place for only gents crowd and separate for family.you can visit the place and taste the yummy starters followed by excellent main course.Show less This place is always full so try and reserve a table.The food is outstanding.The steamed fish with chilly oyster sauce is to die for.Service is fast and courteous.They will help you select if you get lost in the huge variety.Dont miss if you are a chinese food fan!!Show less It is chinesse at its Tangra best. Very good food. easy on the pocket. However have only sat in the family area not sure how the family area is. Golden Joy is one of the best eateries located in the not to convenient locality of Tangra which was essentially an industrial zone not so long ago. The roads are narrow and bad. But if you can make your way there would find quite some good value for money bars and resturants. This area also known as the China Town used to be the main hub for the Chineese community in Kolkata.The food is good and drinks are cheap. But one problem is that while you visit with family you get to sit upstairs which is nicely decorated and recently rennovated, offers a great ambience and good service. But if you are visiting as stags you are made to sit below in a small dingy ugly place with pathetic service. But still, it is worth visiting if you plan to booze as drinks come very cheap and makes up for the lack of good ambience.Show less Well, you can come to this place when you must have tried everything else on earth. Golden Joy is actually located in not so convenient place. People who are from the area or know the local can only reach others have to rely on gps or the word of mouth.Parking is ample. Not a problem. The hotel person/wallet who gets your car shamelessly would ask for a tip while you would leave.Service is not that good and not at all great. You will not be even asked for water. They won\\'t give you. You will have to ask for it. No one even comes with the menu. In fact I would say they do not come for anything by themselves. And even when you call for them the first time they ignore as if you were not heard. Second time they say they are coming. Then finally when you call the third time they come. This is the worst type of service. They are always crowded and they have a huge seating arrangement. But then whats the use of this vastness when you can\\'t even serve properly and attend people properly.Now lets come to the food. Its OK and not good. Our non-veg friends enjoyed but not that much, and we vegetarians were not that happy. In our whole time of eating no attendant or waiter or table managers came to us. Horrible, simply horrible. Food came quickly. Probably because they were mass-cooking things thats why they could serve faster.The bill came after three times of asking and after 15 minutes. The shameless waiter would ask for the tip. For the first time ever we did not leave a single penny for tip.I would not have written this review as you could just not even consider this for your chinese food craving but I seriously would like the restaurant management people to read this. But then they would never have time as they are never short of customers. No one to hear. No damn service.Show less I have gone to this place quite a few times. If you happen to be seating in the family area the service is decent. If its a boys only group they make you sit in a dark dingy place with horrible service. The service was pathetic that I could not believe what was happening. On top of the disgusting service, they actually asked for a tip, yes asked. I left promising to myself never to come back ever again.Show less A great place with good ambiance and above all superb Chinese food. I am visiting this restaurant for the last 6 years and seen it growing every year. The recent renovation has made it even more beautiful in terms of ambiance. Great value and Taste which hasn\\'t change at all in these years. Its a great place for family gathering and party also. Keep it up team Golden Joy...all the best.Show less Though the Restaurant is hard to locate and difficult to reach. After reaching you won\\'t regret.The food is awesome, specially in starter the Crispy Pepper Chicken and Garlic Fish in main course. They offer many more delicacies which I hope will be equally good. The waiters will gladly help you select the correct dish as per your taste and anything you cannot consume will be packed. This was my second visit to this place and I hope to be there soon. A good option for somebody visiting China Town and want to have authentic Chinese. A word of Caution: Reach the place early or else you need to wait as it remains full most of the time. You can pre book as well. They have a separate family arena.Show less Great chinese food. It is one of the larger and more established places in Tangra which is a traditional chinese ghetto of Kolkata. The area used to be primarily factories and tanneries before most moved out of the city a few years back. So it definitely has character and while approaching you will feel that you are lost and that there could not be anything good in this neighbourhood. Once you manage to get there through the narrow/unlit lanes, you are surprised with a well lit restaurant, valet parking takes care of finding parking. The food is very good and not your typical pujabi-chineese place. While not fully authentic, I think it is closer to china-chinese than almost anywhere else. They also do the indian vegetarian friendly dishes, but with more authentic flavor. We noticed a few celebrities also. The service was great, it was a bit on the slow side once the restaurant filled up. It was acceptable oveall. The bill is very reasonable and a good surprise on the way out. Definitely worth going to if you like chinese food and love a bit of adventure.Show less Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu.

Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through.

But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed.

Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil.

Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor.

Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes.

If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around.

Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average.

Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers.

Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu.

Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around.

We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended.

Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through.

But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed.

Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil.

Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor.

Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes.

If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around.

Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average.

Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers.

Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu.

Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around.

We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended.

Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through.

But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed.

Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil.

Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor.

Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes.

If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around.

Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average.

Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers.

Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu.

Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended. But skip the soup…and anything called thread!Show less Well,it\\'s an average Indo Chinese restaurant where consistency of dishes are not stable, some are good and some poor, service is slow and they even served our vegetarian friends with non veg stuff. The price points are attractive, not very expensive. Good for big groups. The food at Golden Joy is excellent and very consistent. We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around.

We always have their steamed prawn & chicken Sui Mai which never disappoints. They have a very large seating and also have smaller spaces for groups wanting them. Extremely helpful staff and the owner Robert Liao and his sons are always around. For Chinese food, this is my number 1..Show less Golden Joy is a nice resturant cum bar.You can enjoy various type of foods here with big group.Staffs are well and helpful to select menu. Golden Joy is a nice resturant in China Town, Kolkata.You can enjoy various types of food and alcohol here.Nice inside environment and good staffs. Heard lot about the place! Was disappointed with food and ambience. Not sure what ws all the rush about. Food was average in taste. Tried golden fried prawns as well. Portion size was good but the taste was average. If you want chinese food there may be other great options! Show less Had lunch here today. Starters included Chili Pork, Chicken Lollipop and Fooyong. The Fooyong was forgettable as was the Lollipop. Pork was decent.Main courses included Meifoon Rice Noodles (good) and Lemon Chicken (acceptable).All said, not a bad place to dine, but only if you have no other options.Show less Food was not good and tasty , restaurant was over crowded , staffs were pathetic , shouting in front of customers. Used to be very good but my last visit was a big disappointment. Mostly local young crowd visit this place considering alcohol being quite reasonably priced. Super lousy, terrible ambience, horrible service and below par food quality. Only good for a quick couple of standard drinks. Located in Tangra famous for many other Chinese eateries, this one is not to be missed.1) The compound just adjacent to it is used for parking with valet services 2) Be sure to be early as the waiting can get lengthy 3) They have one of the best waiting systems. If seats are full, patrons are requested to wait in the terrace with ample space. When asked to wait, a coupon with number is given which is the called to as and when the time comes. Very professionally arranged4) Most of the captains are well informed and will advice you perfectly in ordering.5) Don’t forget the pudding( caramel custard) : it’s overlooked but a must tryShow less We were recommended to visit this restaurant and boy ! We were not disappointed! We had chilli duck / golden fried prawns ! It’s hidden gem in Tangra ! Do visit ! At 10:30 pm also we had to wait for seating We ordered fish fry and hakka noodles. Tasty. Value for money.\\n The ambience is bit noisy and crowdy type. Nice staff. No tips. Serves liquor. It was one of my fav places in kolkata when I talk about chinese, however recently they included Pork to their menu and the worst you expected was the same utensil being used for other dishes. A well settled , high demand and trusted restaurant shouldng have done this as we have regular customers from different sects of the society like vegans and halal seekers. Should avoid if you have trouble with pork no matter how many times the stewards tell you that they have a separate utensil. I sneaked in my self to verify this.Show less The restaurant is pretty popular with the locals and was crowded even on a weekday. \\n   Our friends ordered a chicken soup, fried chicken, noodles and fried rice. It was good, although I would have preferred authentic Chinese food. We tried pepper chicken, golden fried prawn, thread paneer, chinese chicken chopsuey, egg fried rice and chicken hot garlic. Food was awesome. The green chilli chutney was simply too good to go with the starters. Ambience was good. We had been there early on a Sunday. By the time we finished, the place was packed. Will visit again when in KolkataShow less Things start shaky. Seafood Soup (Rs 120) that I decide to start with and various other soups that my team order all turn out to be glorified dish water. Thread Chicken (Rs 350) that my server enthusiastically recommends calling it all-time best seller also turns out to be a bit of a dud, with fried vermicelli clinging on to tasteless morsels of chicken. But soon things perk up.Bhetki Fish Fry (Rs 550) has flaky fish encased in a halfhearted batter but it is the quality of the fish that carries the dish through. Shrimp Cake (Rs 450) is more of a jhinga cutlass (as one would call it in Mumbai) and is piping hot and delicious. The star of the meal is steamed Fish Fillet with chilly, pepper, garlic (Rs 800) which is fish at its best. It is a dish that will bring me to this restaurant many times in future too I am sure. Veg Pan Fried noodles (Rs 180) is delicious and comforting too, and Veg Chowmein (Rs 140) simply hits the spot. All in all amazing food. Much recommended.
