Exception: 'list' object has no attribute 'replace' generated by the following text: '['NEW DELHI: Akasa Air, the startup budget airline launched on August 7 with late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala as its biggest investor, has said it remains â\\x80\\x9cwell-capitalisedâ\\x80\\x9d and will induct the ordered 72 aircraft over the next five years. It will also place a â\\x80\\x9csignificantly largerâ\\x80\\x9d aircraft order in the next 1.5 years. The airline inducted its third Boeing 737 MAX on Tuesday.We will continue to grow our fleet by adding one new aircraft every two weeks. We at Akasa Air continue to mourn the passing of Jhunjhunwala, this is a deep personal loss. Thanks in no small part to Jhunjhunwala, Akasa is a well-capitalised airline with the financial means to induct 72 aircraft over the next five years,\" Akasa founder-CEO Vinay Dube said.\"In fact, our financial platform is strong enough to allow Akasa to place an aircraft order in the next 18 months that will be significantly larger than our first. In simple terms, our growth is secure,â\\x80\\x9d he added.Industry insiders say Jhunjhunwala family holds about 47% stake in Akasa, followed by nearly 30% with founder-CEO Vinay Dube and the rest with other investors and staff. The biggest investorâ\\x80\\x99s demise was seen as a setback to the newborn airline. Akasa has sought to ally those concerns.We are also thankful that Jhunjhunwala supported us in recruiting some of the best aviation talent in the country. He wanted us to have a top-notch leadership team that made all day-to-day decisions at the airline without having to fall back on him or any other investor. Anyone that saw him on our inaugural flight on August 7 knows how proud he was of each Akasa employee and partner. On our part, we couldnt be prouder and more fortunate to have known him,â\\x80\\x9d Dube said.He said Jhunjhunwala recognised Indias potential as one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world with an unparalleled potential and decades of progressâ\\x80\\x9d ahead of us. â\\x80\\x9cHe was a true believer in Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s potential and saw Akasa Air serving our nation by building the transportation links that will support Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s ongoing economic transformation. Akasa Air will honour Jhunjhunwalaâ\\x80\\x99s legacy, values, and belief in us by striving to run an extraordinary airline, Dube said.']' \n"
